        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <h3>How the data sources and measures were decided:</h3>

        This project’s data is scraped from the World Bank and IMF. This project will examine both nominal GDP (in
        current US dollars) and GDP PPP (in current international dollars). In general, the nominal GDP measure is
        better for comparing similar developed entities, and the GDP PPP measure is better for comparing dissimilar
        developed entities. However it is important to keep in mind that many languages will contain collections of both
        developed and developing countries. However, in general, the nominal GDP measure will tend to favor languages
        that mostly contain developed countries with strong formal sectors, while the GDP PPP measure will provide a
        more balanced view of developing countries with strong informal sectors.

        <h3>How the default country-to-language relationships were generated:</h3>

        There are several ways to approximate the economic value of a language. This project analyzes the language
        demographics of each country on Wikipedia. If the country’s language demographics cannot be found on Wikipedia,
        then that country’s GDP will be assigned to the “Other” language group.

        However, if the country’s language demographics can be found, and if greater than 50% of a country's native
        population are L1 (native) speakers of a single language, then that country’s entire GDP is assigned to the
        largest language. If no single language reaches the 50% mark for inclusion, then that country's entire GDP is
        assigned to the "Other" category. This does not account for the impact of L2 speakers.

        I grouped all dialects together, even though some are mutually unintelligible. This is especially notable for
        Chinese and Arabic. However it's worth noting that even if I broke off Hong Kong and assigned it to Cantonese,
        it would still not be big enough to make the top 20 list. The same goes for Catalonia, and ex-Yugoslavia, and
        all the other Chinese/Arabic dialects.

        Special exceptions were made to manually assign Singapore to English, Indonesia to Indo-Malay, Malaysia to
        Indo-Malay, based upon community feedback of previous editions of this report. Here are some links to previous
        editions of this report, which were posted on Reddit:
